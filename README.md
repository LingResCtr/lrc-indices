# lrc-indices
Source files from the LRC's deprecated journal indices.

## Background

The LRC has long maintained a collection of web pages at the address `www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc`.  This collection of web pages included indices to articles published in the journals *General Linguistics* and the *Journal of Indo-European Studies*.

With recent University-wide server changes, the LRC's online materials have shifted to [https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/lrc]().  This change has brought what the LRC hopes are significant improvements to the functionality of the online materials, and it has also provided an opportunity to streamline the online offerings in order to dedicate maintenance to, and focus on expansion of, the LRC's core assets moving forward.

As a result of very low traffic and the extremely specialized nature of the content, the LRC has for the time being deprecated the journal indices.

## Invitation

Low traffic doesn't mean no traffic, and the indices may yet prove useful to some researchers.  So we have created this repository to ensure the data remains available to those who find it of use.  We in fact invite you help us improve the materials, and we hope you can incorporate them into projects of your own.  Fork and submit pull requests!  Create issues!  Hack away!
